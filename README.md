## This is a Mod that makes Lily Go Fast

This mod relies on RE-UE4SS as the base modloader so please install that before moving on: </br>
https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS </br>
In UE4SS you might want to disable the console so go to the config (UE4SS-settings.ini)


### Variables to Modify

There are 2 variables that are easy to change in the top of the main.lua file and those are:

`speedKey` </br>
This is the variable that you can change to modify what key to press to enable the mod (the default is F2) </br>
If you do not have an F2 key you can change the speedKey to any of the keys listed here: https://docs.ue4ss.com/dev/lua-api/table-definitions/key.html. </br>

`speedMultiplier` </br>
This is the number variable that changes the speed multiplier for Lily. </br>


Enjoy the mod!
