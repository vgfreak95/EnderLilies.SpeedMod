## This is a Mod that makes Lily Go Fast

# THIS IS A LUA MOD NOT A CPP MOD

This mod relies on RE-UE4SS as the base modding SDK so please install that before moving on
In UE4SS you might want to disable the console so go to the config (UE4SS-settings.ini)

There are 2 variables that are easy to change in main.lua and those are:

`speedKey`
This is the variable that you can change to modify what key to press to enable the mod
`speedMultiplier`
This is the variable that changes the speed multiplier for lily


Enjoy the mod!
